# Intro
I am a second-year student at the University of Maryland, College Park pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning. Aside from school, I work at the Internal Revenue Service, where I help develop an automated fraud detection system to prevent civil non-compliance and identity theft. In the research realm, my focus lies in Reinforcement Learning and Data Analytics. Outside of academia, I enjoy going on hikes and playing golf. Feel free to reach out for any opportunities or to connect!
